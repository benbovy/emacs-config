emacs-config
============

My emacs configuration.


Installation
------------

- install emacs, e.g., using brew:

$ brew cask install emacs

- install [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude).

- run the install script that symlink emacs configuration files:

    $ python install.py

- there is also a plist file to setup a service on MacOS with, e.g.,
  [launchrocket](https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket)
  (unfortunately, the emacs cask doesn't support `brew services`).
